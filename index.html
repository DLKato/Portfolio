  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope it gives you a clear impression of the skills I have developed throughout my studies in Product Development. With this collection, I aim to showcase my versatility as a designer, from SolidWorks and digital drawing to hands-on prototyping.</p>
  <p>Most of the projects featured here were created during my time at the University of Antwerp, although you’ll also find a few that were driven by personal passion and curiosity beyond the curriculum.</p>

<!-- About Me -->
<section id="about" class="text-section">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Curiosity and a drive to learn have always guided me. This has led me to the study field of Product Development, a multidisciplinary field that gives me the tools and the flexibility to explore, adapt, and grow across different areas of design and innovation. I may not yet know the exact path I want to follow, but I am confident that my eagerness to take on new challenges will lead me there.</p>
  <p>What I do know is that I come alive when I am prototyping. It is during this hands-on phase, where ideas transform into tangible, testable solutions, that a product truly begins to breathe. Making concepts real gives me a deep sense of purpose and momentum.</p>
  <p>But for me, design is never a solo journey. I am at my best when I am co-creating with others. I firmly believe that collaboration brings out stronger ideas, sharper thinking, and more meaningful results. Working together fuels innovation and brings joy to the process.</p>
  <p>If I had to describe myself in five key words, they would be: Social, Optimistic, Creative, Curious, and Organized.</p>
